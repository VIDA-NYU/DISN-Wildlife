<h1 id="project">DISN Wildlife</h1>

Wildlife trafficking is one of the most common illicit activities globally, alongside weapons and human
trafficking. It presents a serious threat to biodiversity and has had substantial human cost and
detrimental effects including fueling crime, violence and environmental destruction. The COVID-19
pandemic, likely caused by a virus that jumped from wildlife to humans, has brought attention to the
fact that wildlife trade can also have serious public health and biosafety implications.
Traffickers increasingly make use of technology to streamline their activities and, at the same time,
to evade detection. Internet platforms provide an easy mechanism for globalized buying and selling,
which has put new pressure on wild populations of endangered and threatened species (e.g., elephants,
rhinos, tigers, as well as hundreds of other lesser known species). While this creates
challenges, it also opens new opportunities. As criminals use technology, complex trafficking networks
leave traces of their activity on the web, and by identifying and connecting these traces, we can obtain
insights into how the trafficking networks work as well as how they can be detected and disrupted.
